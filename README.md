**Try the demo!** The dashboard automatically runs in demo mode when deployed to the cloud, showing realistic simulated data.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š Real-time parameter monitoring (Voltage, Current, Power)
- ðŸ“ˆ Live graphs and visualizations with Plotly
- ðŸ’¾ Historical data tracking (last 50 readings)
- ðŸ”Œ RS485/Modbus RTU communication (hardware mode)
- ðŸŽ® Demo mode with simulated data (cloud mode)
- âš¡ Support for 3-phase voltage and current measurements
- ðŸ“‰ Frequency and Power Factor monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Auto-refresh with configurable intervals

## Demo Mode

When running on Streamlit Cloud (or any environment without serial ports), the dashboard automatically switches to **Demo Mode**, displaying realistic simulated data:

- Voltage: 230V Â±5V with realistic fluctuations
- Current: 10A Â±2A with load variations  
- Frequency: 50Hz Â±0.1Hz
- Power Factor: 0.85 Â±0.05
- Active and Reactive Power calculations

Perfect for demonstrations, training, or portfolio showcases!
